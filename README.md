# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **time-series prediction model** for stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks. The model leverages historical stock price data to forecast future price trends, showcasing the application of **deep learning in financial forecasting**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Preprocess and structure stock price data for time-series modeling.  
- Apply **LSTM neural networks** to capture sequential dependencies in financial data.  
- Evaluate the model’s ability to predict future stock prices.  
- Demonstrate the use of deep learning for financial decision support.
